  tasks:
  - name: Execute a command on the host
    command: hostname -s
    register: hostname_output
  - name: show  the hostname_output
    debug:
      var: hostname_output.stdout

Before we begin next playbook, lets look at Setup module and Fact variable:
===========================================

# ansible webserver -m setup
It gives lot of information

# ansible webserver -m setup | wc -l

It will return total number of lines
# ansible webserver -m setup -a "filter=ansible_memfree_mb"

It will return value for given ansible variable.
# ansible webserver -m setup -a "filter=ansible_mem*"


# vim playbookfact.yml
- hosts: webserver
  tasks:
  - name: Show Ipaddress of the host servers
    debug:
      msg="The ipaddress of host server  is {{ ansible_default_ipv4.address }}"
